<h1>Sallys School Of Motoring | Code Institute First Milestone Project</h1>

<p>This project is a front end only website which has been designed for a driving school business called Sally’s School Of Motoring. The website contains a 
number of useful features such as the ability for users to see lesson pricing, send an enquiry form to sally, see information regarding sally’s 
business and view testimonies from previous students. </p>

<p>The website also contains a useful page devoted to instructing students on the process of learning to drive and how this can be achieved.</p>

<p>The website can be viewed on Github Live Pages via the following address: https://spawson.github.io/sallys-school-of-motoring/</p>

<h2>UX</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This website is primarily focused on users who are wanting to learn to drive and is therefore designed in order to provide these users with clear information regarding the driving school.
Furthermore, it is hoped that through a user’s positive experience with the website, it will increase the likelihood of this person taking up driving lessons with Sally’s driving school. </p>

<h3>Wireframes</h3>

<p>During the development stage of my project I generated some wireframes for both the mobile and desktop approaches using Balsamiq. Throughout the course of developing the website, I have deviated from the wireframes in certain sections.
This is mainly due to me discovering a better design during the development, or issues with implementing the feature. </p>

<p>The wireframes have uploaded with the rest of my project and can be viewed <a href="">here.</a></p>

<h3>User Stories</h3>

<p>In the development stage of the project, I generated a number of user stories which heavily influenced the design decisions taken throughout the development of the website. They are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>As a customer, I would like to be see a clear pricing strategy to determine if the lesson prices are within my budget.</li>
<li>As a customer, I would like the ability to submit an enquiry form so as to easily express my interest in taking driving lessons.</li>
<li>As a customer, I would like to see information about the driving instructor, so I can make a more informed decision.</li>
<li>As a customer, I would like to see what areas the instructor covers, so that I can see if they provide lessons where I live.</li>
<li>As a customer, I would like to see customer testimonies to increase my confidence in choosing the driving school for their services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>

<h4>Feature 1 - Navigation Bar</h4>

<p>The navigation menu allows the user to navigate around the website by clicking the various links to other pages. The navigation is mobile friendly and collapses into the ‘burger icon’ menu to reduce overcrowding on a small screen. Furthermore,
visual feedback is used to illustrate to the user on which page they are on.</p>

<h4>Feature 2 – Jumbotron Call To Action Button</h4>
<p>A call to action button is featured on the homepage jumbotron which allows users to been navigated straight to the lesson pricing page after they read the jumbotron content.</p>

<h4>Feature 3 – Image Carousel</h4>
<p>An image carousel is featured on the homepage which allows users to get a visual
representation of the areas in which the driving school covers. This is achieved by cycling through local landmarks
and allowing users to select through the carousel using the glyphicon buttons.</p>


<h4>Feature 4 – Enquiry Form</h4>
<p>An enquiry form is featured on the homepage and contact page which allows the user to input their information into the contact form. This is then submitted to Sally when the user submits the form using the submit button. Validators are in place to ensure that every field has information entered into it, to reduce the chance of erroneous information being submitted.An image carousel is featured on the homepage which allows users to get a visual
representation of the areas in which the driving school covers. This is achieved by cycling through local landmarks
and allowing users to select through the carousel using the glyphicon buttons.</p>

<h4>Feature 5 – Embeded Videos</h4>
<p>Embedded videos are featured on the learning to drive page and this allows the user to play videos related to the content they are reading to further expand this. 
The user can do this by clicking on the video and then have the option to expand to full screen, to make watching the content easier.</p>

<h4>Feature 6 – Book Now Modal</h4>
<p>A modal is featured on the lesson pricing page and allows the user to activate it, when they press the book now button in the different package blocks.
This allows the user to enter their information into the modal, which is submitted to Sally. The modal contains validators to ensure that all the fields are entered and to limit erroneous information
being submitted</p>

<h4>Feature 7 – Social Links</h4>
<p>A social media list is used in the footer, which allows the user to see other forms of media the driving school use or are associated with.
The user can access these by clicking on the relevant media icons. E.g. The Facebook icon will open the driving schools Facebook page.</p>

<h3>Features left to implement</h3>

<h4>Feature 1 – Add read more button functionality</h4>
<p>I would like to use JavaScript to add a slide animation onto a read more button on the other services section. This would allow most of the information to be revealed when the button is pressed
, which would improve the user experience and take up less space.</p>

<h4>Feature 2 – Add submission feedback to contact forms</h4>
<p>The addition of feedback to the user when submitting the form would enhance the user experience, as this would give indication to the user that they had successfully submitted their form.</p>

<h4>Feature 3 – Testimonies Carousel</h4>
<p>I would like to add a carousel for the customer testimonies, as I think it would improve the user experience if they were able to cycle through the testimonies using buttons.
This would mean more testimonies could be included for display and this would take up less screen real estate.</p>
